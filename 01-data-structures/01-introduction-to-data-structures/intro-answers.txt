1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

while this does seem like a simple structure I feel that devs could easily access and manipulate data. The devs can push data in and manipulate with the other methods provided.

2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?

devs can use the method search to find a specific element in the data structure. 

3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?

Our line data structure can represent as some type of queue in various things like putting yourself in a waitlist at a resturant, or queuing up in a game server when there's too many players

Our screen/pixel data structure can also represent a graph for some type of data.
